## Plant Optimization Models in R

A (very) thin **R** wrapper around a **pl**ant **o**ptimization **mo**deling framework written in Rust.

Currently under construction, but needs to be public to access the free tier MacOS 14 + M1 runners.

Expect many breaking changes moving forward. 

Currently working on a soil-hydraulics focused transpiration model.

Intend to add more models and bake in more flexibility down the road.
